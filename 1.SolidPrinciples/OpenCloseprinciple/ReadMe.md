The **Open/Closed Principle** is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that:

> **Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.**

This means you should be able to add new functionality to a class or module without changing its existing code. This is typically achieved by using interfaces or abstract classes and then extending them with new implementations.

**Example:**

Suppose you have an `InvoiceSaver` interface. You can create new classes like `InvoiceDBSaver`, `InvoiceFileSave`, or `InvoiceBackupDBSaver` that implement this interface, without modifying the original code. This allows your code to be easily extended with new saving mechanisms, while keeping the existing code stable and unchanged.

**Benefits:**

- Reduces the risk of introducing bugs in existing code.
- Makes the system easier to maintain and extend.
- Encourages the use of abstraction and polymorphism.
